# Fractal Viewer

Fractal Viewer is a web page that let's you visualize [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). There are 5 different fractals: Mandelbrot and 4 Julia ones with different parameters. You can move the fractal around, zoom in and out, and even change the factor value. [Try it out!](https://diogit.github.io/CGI-Project-1/fractals.html)
